## My process
firstly, I deal handled the structure of the webpage an defining all my Div and classes.
I styled the body first before I styled the remaining div and centered my div to the center of the page.
positioning the element in the center of the page was challenging but achieved.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned
I am a newbie to the game and apparently i wanted to challenge what i have learnt from my bootcamp before i carry on with my learning. It is very good to take on projects to test what you have learnt so far and apply it. To center the div and using the
display flex with min-height 100bvh was not taught in my bootcamp but i had to learn it and understand and apply it.
also, always use nested divs (apparently its really flexible for work)

### Continued development
- I want to master the frontend aspect, my goal is to become a fullstack dev and i will achieve it.
- I want to also master the concept of centering elements in css.
- I have not even entered Javascript yet. wish me luck ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚


### Useful resources

- [Completed Qr compomet challenge](https://codepen.io/iamsofiullah/pen/OJxKwGx?editors=1100) - This helped me to learn the whole concept of the challenge after hours of struggling. it was just used as a bench mark to understand what was going on
